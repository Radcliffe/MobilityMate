# Mobility Mate

Mobility Mate is a mobile-first, browser-based application and web service. It utilizes crowd-sourcing to collect 
accessibility data for people with mobility disabilities, and it overlays this information on a Google map. The project
is at an early stage of development, so the code might not work.

## Usage

* The application has been deployed to Google App Engine at https://mobility-mate.appspot.com/.
